title: Risk factors associated with loneliness, social isolation, and neuroticism
  in the UK Biobank cohort
subtitle: ''
summary: 'In this study, we show that self-perceived loneliness coincides
  with objective measures of social isolation as well as the personality trait neuroticism,
  and that these comorbidities contribute to differential associations with risk factors
  including depression, social deprivation, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular
  risk, and aging of the brain.'

abstract: Amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for establishing
  knowledge about risk factors for adverse health outcomes associated with loneliness
  and social isolation. In this study, we show that self-perceived loneliness coincides
  with objective measures of social isolation as well as the personality trait neuroticism,
  and that these comorbidities contribute to differential associations with risk factors
  including depression, social deprivation, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular
  risk, and aging of the brain. The findings contribute to identifying groups of individuals
  who may be vulnerable to loneliness and associated health problems, and emphasize
  the need for public-health initiatives addressing socioeconomic conditions as well
  as social, mental, and physical health to reduce the risk of loneliness and adverse
  health outcomes in the population.
