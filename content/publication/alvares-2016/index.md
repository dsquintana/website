abstract: 'Background: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is a putative underlying
  mechanism for increased cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with psychiatric
  disorders. Previous studies suggest that this risk may be related to psychotropic
  medication use. In the present study we systematically reviewed and analyzed published
  studies of heart rate variability (HRV), measuring ANS output, to determine the
  effect of psychiatric illness and medication use.  Methods: We searched for studies
  comparing HRV in physically healthy adults with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder
  to controls and comparing HRV pre- and post-treatment with a psychotropic medication.  Results:
  In total, 140 case-control (mood, anxiety, psychosis, dependent disorders, k = 151)
  and 30 treatment (antidepressants, antipsychotics; k = 43) studies were included.
  We found that HRV was reduced in all patient groups compared to controls (Hedges
  g = -0.583) with a large effect for psychotic disorders (Hedges g = -0.948). Effect
  sizes remained highly significant for medication-free patients compared to controls
  across all disorders. Smaller and significant reductions in HRV were observed for
  specific antidepressants and antipsychotics.  Limitations: Study quality significantly
  moderated effect sizes in case-control analyses, underscoring the importance of
  assessing methodological quality when interpreting HRV findings.  Conclusion: Combined
  findings confirm substantial reductions in HRV across psychiatric disorders, and
  these effects remained significant even in medication-free individuals. Reductions
  in HRV may therefore represent a significant mechanism contributing to elevated
  cardiovascular risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders. The negative impact
  of specific medications on HRV suggest increased risk for cardiovascular disease
  in these groups, highlighting a need for treatment providers to consider modifiable
  cardiovascular risk factors to attenuate this risk.'
