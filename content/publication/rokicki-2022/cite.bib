	abstract = {Oxytocin plays a vital role in social behavior and homeostatic processes, with animal models indicating that oxytocin receptor (OXTR) expression patterns in the brain influence behavior and physiology. Here we demonstrate a distinct pattern of OXTR gene expression in the human brain across the lifespan, with an OXTR expression peak during early childhood. We also show that networks of genes with strong spatio-temporal couplings with OXTR are enriched in several psychiatric illness and body composition phenotypes.},
