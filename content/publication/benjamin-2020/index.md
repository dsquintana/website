title: Reduced heart rate variability is associated with disease severity in psychosis
  spectrum disorders
subtitle: ''
summary: 'In this study we investigated heart rate variability (HRV), a proxy for vagal activity, as a biological marker for disease severity in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated in 35 patients with SZ and 52 patients with BD, as well as in 146 healthy controls Results suggest that disease severity is associated with autonomic dysfunction.'

abstract: 'Background: While a growing literature links cardiac autonomic dysregulation
  to a variety of psychiatric disorders, the relationship between cardiac autonomic
  functioning and specific symptoms in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD)
  remains elusive. Thus, we investigated heart rate variability (HRV), a proxy for
  vagal activity, as a biological marker for disease severity in patients with SZ
  and BD.   Methods: HRV was calculated in 35 patients with SZ and 52 patients with
  BD, as well as in 146 healthy controls. In the patient groups, disease severity
  and function were measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and
  the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale.   Results: HRV was significantly
  lower in both clinical groups compared to the healthy controls, with no HRV differences
  between patient groups. PANSS general psychopathology scores, GAF symptom scores,
  and GAF function scores showed statistically significant associations with HRV across
  groups.   Conclusions: These results suggest that disease severity is associated
  with autonomic dysfunction. Thus, HRV may provide a potential biomarker of disease
  severity in SZ and BD.'
